// BROWSER MEASUREMENT SPEC — the one proof that no data is hidden on a phone.
//
// This is the only spec in the repo that needs a real viewport, and it exists because the defect
// it catches is invisible to every other kind of check: the page reported
// `scrollWidth === clientWidth === 390` — perfectly "no horizontal page scroll" — while the
// ENDURANCE column of the fleet roster was sheared off the right edge and the header rendered as a
// bare "E". A green page-scroll assertion was the CAMOUFLAGE for hidden data.
//
// THE ASSERTION, per table, in the words of the rule it enforces:
//   1. Either the table FITS its container, or the container is genuinely scrollable
//      (overflow-x auto/scroll AND scrollWidth > clientWidth). Clipping is neither.
//   2. Scrolled to the far end, the LAST cell of every row is fully inside the container. This is
//      what "reachable" actually means, and it is what a bare overflow rule does not guarantee.
//   3. Scrolled to the far end, the FIRST cell of every body row is still on screen — the row's
//      identity and its tap target. That is the reach law applied to a scroll container.
//   4. The page itself still never moves sideways.
//
// HOW TO RUN IT. It needs the app served:
//     npm run build && npm run preview        (or: npm run dev, then set the base URL)
//     npx playwright test layout.spec.ts
// Point it elsewhere with PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL (see playwright.config.ts).
//
// If nothing is served the tests SKIP with a stated reason rather than pass — a skip is visibly a
// skip, and a proof that goes green without measuring anything is worse than no proof at all.
//
// NOT RUN IN CI: .github/workflows/build.yml runs lint + tsc + vite build only; there are no
// browser binaries in the runner. This is a local gate, and it is stated here so a green CI tick
// can never be mistaken for a measured layout.
